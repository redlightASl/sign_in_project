# sign_in_project

# A single project in "National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program"

## General
This is an experimental software and hardware co-design solution for sutdents signing-in.
Aiming at college, we tried to achieve convenient check-in and check-out service through face recognition.

### Hardware solution
Based on STM32H7xx high performance MCU and ESP32 WiFi&BLE module,we developed a set of **demo board** plan and a test-plan with **evaluation board**.We were expected to design a set of PCB for this programme in the future.
### Software solution
The server backend is based on **SpringBoot**+**Hibernate**+**MySQL** and the frontend is based on **Vue.js**. It is deployed on linux. We also develop an Android APP as the mobile client.
